# Pong Game with C and AVR
This project implements the classic Pong game using the C programming language and AVR microcontroller. The game is designed to be played on a hardware setup that includes an AVR microcontroller, a display LM044L (4x20 LCD), and input devices such as buttons or a Keypad.

## Prerequisites
To run this game on your AVR microcontroller, you'll need the following:

- AVR microcontroller (e.g., ATmega32)
- Display module (e.g., LCD )
- Input devices (e.g., buttons, Keypad)
- GCC compiler using Eclipse.

## Usage

- Open the project in your AVR development environment.

- Include the necessary header files for your display module and input devices in the main source file.

- Implement the necessary initialization functions for your display module and input devices. This may include configuring pins and other settings.

- Modify the game settings such as paddle size, ball speed, and initial positions according to your preference.

- Implement the game logic and rendering functions based on the provided template. You can add additional features or customize the game as desired.

- Build and flash the compiled code onto your AVR microcontroller.

- Connect the display module and input devices to the AVR microcontroller.

- Power up the hardware and start playing the Pong game!
